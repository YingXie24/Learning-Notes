<h2>Roles and skills of data professionals </h2>
<h3> Data analytics </h3>
- Output is used internally to make business decisions
- Analyse data for the purpose of making a decision/ answer questions
- For example:
  - What happened?
  - Why did it happen (root causing)?
  - What is likely to happen (forecasting)?
  - What action should we take?
- Background: Open ended
- Skills: SQL/ Communication/ Biz Acumen
- Roles: Analyst/ Marketing/ BI

<h3>Data science </h3>
- Output reaches external customers
- Decision based (advanced statistical modelling) - complex solutions on what action should we take
- Feature-based (building data products)- shopping recommendations, advertisement targeting, netflix tv suggestions
- Background: CompSci, Quantitative Field (Physics, Math, Statistics)- Graduate degree!
- Skills: Programming (Python & R)/ Statistics
- Roles: Data Scientist/ ML Engineer

<h3> Data engineering/ data infrastructure/ data architecture</h3>
- Collection, storage, processing and transfer of data that enables data analytics and data science
- eg implementing infrastructure allowing real-time recommendations to display immediately after activity on the site
- Background: CompSci/ Software Engineering
- Skills: Programming/ Database system
- Roles: Data warehousing, developing and maintaining distributed systems, and building data pipelines

<h2> The data analytics "tool triangle" </h2>
1. Spreadsheet
2. Database & SQL  (we store data in a database, we access the data in our database by writing SQL, we write SQL in a SQL client)
3.BI Software

<h2>Data pipeline: how data moves from collection to analysis</h2>
Data source > raw data > raw data database > ETL > Analytic database > Analysis
External data source > raw data > API> ETL >^

<h3>ETL</h3>
1. Extract: Pull raw data out from a database
2. Transform: Do stuff to the raw data (convert, delete, filter)
3. Load: Store transformed data in to a separate database (this database is called the analytic database)

<h3>API Application Programming Interface</h3>
Technology that bridges systems together and enables the sharing of data
